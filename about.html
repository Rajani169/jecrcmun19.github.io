      An extraordinary intellectual and social conference, JECRC Model United Nations 2019 is an event which brings together a mixed group of young minds from across India who play the role of diplomats for a period of two days and gain first hand experience of negotiating processes.<br>
      At JECRC MUN, delegates gain insight into the workings of the United Nations and the dynamics of international relations by assuming the roles of world leaders and international decision makers. Participants can use this platform to debate most important issues of the society and also to develop several skills throughout the process.<br>
      JECRC MUN 2019 builds upon years of experience. In 2012, JECRC held its first annual Model United Nations. This timespan makes JECRC MUN the premier MUN event in INDIA.<br>
