    <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
    <p class='detail'>
    JECRC MUN, being conducted from 2012, has now become a widely acclaimed Model United Nations platform. Over the years, it has developed itself as the ideal to strengthen the skills of diplomacy and leadership.<br> 
    Beholding the success of our annual event, this year we are bringing JECRC Intra MUN for you. Having 5 councils and an expected participation of over 300 delegates, this is a break through opportunity in MUN for JECRC students. With this, we affirm, that our dominance in the region would henceforth strengthen.<br>
    The following councils would be simulated for JECRC Intra MUN 2019:<br>
    {% for ct in site.data.committees %}
    <br>{{ forloop.index }}. <strong>{{ ct.name }} : </strong>{{ ct.agenda }}
    {% endfor %}
